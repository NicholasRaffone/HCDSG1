oy6t0z,h7qzsmv,/r/TrueCrime/comments/oy6t0z/balbir_singh_sodhi_was_a_sikh_who_lived_in_mesa/h7qzsmv/,,"Balbir Singh Sodhi was a Sikh who lived in Mesa, Arizona.  He was murdered 4 days after September 11, 2001 after being mistaken for muslim by a Boeing employee who wanted to ""retaliate"" for the World Trade Center attacks.Frank Silva Roque, a Boeing aircraft mechanic at a local repair facility, told a waitress at Applebee’s that he was going to “shoot some towelheads” after watching news coverage of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.  He later visited a Chevron gas station owned by Balbir Singh Sodhi.  The gas station owner, Balbir Singh Sodhi, had immigrated to the United States from India in 1985.  Sodhi was outside, helping his landscaper plant flowers around the edge of his gas station.Roque approached Sodhi and shot him multiple times with a .380 pistol.  Sodhi died soon after the shooting.  The landscaper, Luis Ledesma, was not hit but rounds came close to him.Roque then drove his car to a Mobile gas station, where he attacked a Lebanese-American employee of that gas station.  Roque did not exit his vehicle, he opened fire from inside his car.  The victim managed to escape unharmed; all of the shots missed and the man managed to find cover before Roque could reload.Finally, Roque drove to the home of a family who had recently immigrated from Afghanistan.  He shot at them through their windows before driving away.Soon after the shootings, Roque went to a local bar and bragged about what he'd done, telling horrified patrons that he’d just avenged the world trade centers.  He apparently thought they would treat him like some sort of hero, instead they called police.  Roque was arrested and charged with first degree murder.  He was found guilty and sentenced to death.In arguing against the death penalty, Roque’s defense focused mainly on mental health factors.  The court found that Roque had an IQ of just 80, he suffered from schizophrenia, and that the events of 9/11 had caused him substantial emotional disturbance.  For these reasons, his death sentence was eventually overturned and replaced with life without parole.Less than a year later, Sukhpal, one of Sodhi’s multiple brothers, was shot and killed in San Francisco.  Sukhpal was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time, and got killed in the crossfire of a gang-related shooting.  Whereas Sodhi’s murder was cold-blooded and premeditated, Sukhpal’s murder was random and pointless; it is unclear which is worse.Balbir Sodhi is listed on the Arizona state 9/11 memorial as a victim of 9/11.  In 2011, Rep. John Kavanaugh (R) introduced a bill that would have removed Balbir Sodhi from the state’s 9/11 memorial on the grounds that he was not a victim of the terrorist attacks.  The bill was approved by the legislature, but was ultimately vetoed by Governor Jan Brewer.  Balbir Sodhi remains on the memorial to this day.",1165,1628125616.0

They’d spoken online before, but this was the first time they met in real-life.  However, Neal attacked Heather almost immediately after entering her house.  It’s unclear if he was invited in or if he broke in.  Either way, Heather ended up in a fight for her life.Neal grabbed her neck and squeezed it hard, telling her that he’d kill her if she didn’t do as she was told.  With his other hand, he pointed a gun at her.  Heather managed to slip away momentarily, and a fight ensued.  As Heather fought with Neal, she realized that he wasn’t going to shoot her; he actually wanted to keep her alive, at least in the short-term.Once Heather realized that Neal wouldn’t shoot her, she was able to fight back more effectively.  She grabbed a small rake from her kitchen, the kind used to clean up dog poop.  Heather swung the rake at Neal.  This turned out to be the best thing she could have done, because Neal set down his gun so he could use both hands to grab the rake away from her.As soon as she saw that, Heather let the rake get pulled away from her and dove for the gun instead.  She immediately shot Neal in the head as soon as it was in her hands.  The whole encounter, from the time Neal entered the house to the time he was shot, lasted less than a few minutes.Many people in town would later call her ""Heather the Hero"" for her actions that night, but Heather didn’t feel like a hero; she felt sick.  She’d never wanted to kill anybody; she never asked for this.  When police showed up, she was sobbing hysterically.  She was also injured; she had a broken back and dislocated shoulder from her fight with Neal.This was by far the most traumatic experience of Heather's entire life; she cried profusely throughout her interview with detectives.When a police officer searched Neal’s deceased body, he found 4 pairs of handcuffs; right away that was seen as a red flag. A search of Neal Falls’ car revealed an enormous kill kit.  In Neal Falls' vehicle, police found an axe, a shovel, a sledgehammer, bowie knives, bleach, cleaning supplies, handcuffs, duct tape, guns, and a bulletproof vest.""It's likely that Mr. Falls is a serial killer,"" said Steve Cooper, Charleston Police Department Chief of Detectives. ""I believe she saved lives by shooting Mr. Falls, based on what he did to her and based on the items found in his car.”It would eventually be confirmed that Neal Falls had kidnapped, tortured, and killed at least several other women before he met Heather.",1712,1628809845.0

Basically college dorms scattered all over Fort Hood (which is the size of a small city, 50k people). These barracks are mixed (not always) So you've got 20 something year old young men and women with disposable income and nothing to do but drink and do dumb stuff. Every Friday these 20 somethings are unleashed to do whatever they want until 6am Monday. After a long and monotonous week of hard work that basically always means going wild.On the tame side you get BBQ, loud music, and drinking. But even if 99% of people don't go doing stupid shit, a non zero number do.Fort Hood has a rampant drug problem. This base is located in the middle of Texas and lacks for an abundance of wholesome entertainment. Austin is an hour and a half away. Its surrounded by small cities streets made of mostly strip malls and strip clubs. For whatever reasons, people turn to drugs. This exacerbates all other problems.Fort Hood has a rampant STI problem. Every Friday every solider will hear from their commanders ""for the love of god don't have unprotected sex"" which they will then proceed to do.Fort Hood has a rampant sexual assault problem. When you mix drinking and drugs into these conditions with a bunch of 20 somethings inclined towards macho bullshit you get a disgusting heart breaking amount of rape. A lot of people who join the military are to put it plainly are ill suited to be in this situation. Imagine an amped up drunk hyper masculine 20 something guy taking advantage of a drunk woman unable to consent. Yeah. That ad infinitum.Fort Hood has a rampant mental health problem. There is insufficient support for people grappling with some really difficult stuff.I know what you're thinking, college towns basically have the same conditions. Except these college towns don't have military culture. Its hard to explain why military culture makes people more violent, more likely to be a bystander, or more likely to make bad decisions but it does. Hell even I partook in sketchy hookups and blackout drinking. And after returning from Iraq why the hell wouldn't I?So you've got these conditions, basically a firestorm. How do you douse a firestorm? You change the culture, you reduce bystander syndrome, you get the drugs out and you tamp down on the folks doing the sexual assaulting?Wrong. Double down. When a woman (or a dude) is sexual assaulted you think this becomes a matter for the police right? No. It becomes a matter for military justice. Yeah... On the subject of who is being assaulted and who is doing the assaulting let me make something abundantly clear. I worked adjacent to one of the safety reporting and assistance programs to reduce sexual assault so I have a VERY good idea of this. It's a LOT more guys than you're thinking. Like a lot a lot. I can't give you a great ballpark but its much more than 1/10 but probably less than 5/10. This is also weirdly because of military culture that idolizes masculinity. Guys will haze other guys, and with enough drugs or alcohol, that far too often results in guys gangraping another guy.When you're in the military its sort of like living at a corporation. If you want to report sexual assault you go to HR. The problem is that the military hasn't kept up with best practices fast enough. What if you work in HR and you need to report your boss? There are constantly changing initiatives to make it more anonymous and more safe to report. Its not enough, its never enough. You still have to go to work Monday. You still have to work with your assaulter. You might be ostracized if you report. Very often peoples 'bosses' also fit somewhere into the reporting process.There are ways to report anonymously but this often means no action is taken against an assaulter. Plus maybe several people saw it happen, so even if you report anonymously everyone will know it was you that reported.And remember all of this is happening with your coworkers who you live with, many who are as close as family. Imagine having to tell the front desk lady, your boss, his boss, the CEO and the CFO that Steve from accounting forced himself on you Friday while you were doing illegal drugs or drinking underage.This all creates situations of blinding rage that lead to murder.This all creates situations where someone feels trapped and leads to murder.This all creates situations where someone takes their own life.",141,1622502973.0

np7o2u,h04p20v,/r/TrueCrime/comments/np7o2u/this_memorial_day_many_will_continue_mourning_the/h04p20v/,,"Sexual harassment (towards men and women) was always a key talking point when I was in ten years ago. You could count on a power point about it every month. It's easy enough to understand. Barracks living is basically like living in a locker room with high schoolers. Dongs and sex talk everywhere. It's fun when it's joking around with buddies but when it's more than that people think everyone is having a fun time but people don't realize that some are just laughing to fit in. A guy in my unit was asked how many girls he slept with and he became visibly uncomfortable but kept getting asked until I did the only thing I knew would diffuse the situation by asking the person who asked him how many dudes he slept with, instantly shifted focus. I don't want to downplay the sexual harassment towards women in the military but there is just as much that go on with men and it's severely underreported. No one wants to be ""that guy"" who can't take a joke and narc on people in his unit.  I wouldn't change my experience at all because the good soldiers heavily outweigh the bad but there is a certain atmosphere at times where it's very childish and ruthless. Everyone makes fun of everyone but some people aren't good with that type of ribbing so I'd only joke like that with my good friends, some people didn't have that same boundary and would go way too far with shit.Again though, women in my unit (albeit the were only a handful) had to try to ""man up"" and be one of the guys with these types of shenanigans, I'm sure that was uncomfortable. Not to mention that women are out numbered by an army of 90% men (Not actual figure just a guess). Some people are just creeps but being overseas and surrounded by dudes can make those creeps extra creepy.",15,1622500684.0

One has to wonder why he didn't flee the area like a lot of suspects do? Only thing I could gather is he couldn't afford the move. Plus, it's odd he didn't come up on LE radar before but maybe they had other suspects in mind.Usually when you have these types of cases the person with that many coincidences is the killer. But knowing how this goes he will probably deny it so will likely be a person of interest but not graduate to a suspect. Personally,. I'm 50/50 on this one. Hard to lean one way or another.

In tow was an A&E crew filming an episode of *The First 48*. On the true crime show, homicide detectives have 48 hours to crack a murder case before the trail goes cold. Thirty-four hours earlier, Je’Rean Blake Nobles, 17, had been shot outside a nearby liquor store; an informant had ID’d a man named Chauncey Owens as the shooter and provided this address.>This was the first raid on a house since Officer Brian Huff had been murdered trying to apprehend a suspect two weeks earlier.>The SWAT team threw a flash-bang grenade through the window of the lower unit and kicked open the unlocked door. The grenade landed so close to Aiyana it burned her blanket. Officer Joseph Weekley, the lead commando—who’d been featured before on another A&E show, *Detroit SWAT*—burst into the house. He fired a single shot, striking Aiyana in the head and exiting her neck.>Police had thrown the grenade into the wrong apartment. The suspect in Blake’s murder, Chauncey Owens, lived upstairs with Aiyana’s aunt. Plus, grenades are rarely used when rounding up suspects, even murder suspects.Aiyana’s family received an $8.25 million settlement in 2019: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/detroit-city/2019/04/04/8-25-m-settlement-reached-aiyana-stanley-jones-suit/3340174002/",805,1592673160.0

However, I wanted to comment that I personally do not think your writing style was appropriate. I understand trying to imbue the story with emotional energy & some melodrama maybe, but ultimately it came off as very judgmental toward the victim and honestly of women in general (***especially*** sexually active ones). I don’t think it was intentional **at all** on your part, but it is hopefully some good feedback for you :)Specifically, these are the most glaring things I noticed:  >	God wouldn’t send her to hell….but someone else would.-	saying something like “someone would” in reference to “sending her to hell” is in **incredible** bad taste. It makes me very angry to read something like that about a victim a writer is supposedly trying to create empathy for. >	inform him of her most recent escapades>	the maid wasn’t happy about this little stunt-	“Escapades” isn’t a word I would use to discuss a victim’s previous sexual encounters. My *assumption* would be that she was likely deeply conflicted about her sexual behavior, her religious beliefs, and the judgements from others. When you use a term like “escapades” it trivializes her actions and makes them like a fun day trip in her life journey. Likewise, calling Janet’s actions a “stunt” again trivializes her sexual behaviors and paints her as someone who was just trying to make others jealous of her. >	Janet was going to be punished for her arrogant whorish ways.-	I understand the last one was meant to be from the killers’ point of view, but if it’s not a direct quote, don’t put it like that. There were other parts in there that seemed misogynistic as well, such as the way you talked about Laurie being “jealous or something like that.”  Either claim that Laurie is jealous or that she’s not. Don’t put it out there and then trivialize that emotion right after as if it’s some “cRaZy WoMaN tHiNG ^TM “>	obviously the maid want too happy about that-	minimizing the person to their profession that is an outdated term meant only for women and most often in a demeaning or sexually explicit way. They are usually referred to as “housekeeping staff” to keep those negative connotations away. -	Moreover, this person likely has a name that has been recorded somewhere in your research, but if not, calling someone in housekeeping a “maid” can be disrespectful. -	This woman’s anger was justified and understandable! The way you phrased it again harkens back to the “cRaZy WoMaN tHiNG ^TM “ that I mentioned earlier.

What it also gas in common is that certain of Suzanne's murderers are out of prison now.I find these pack killings far scarier and repulsive than lone serial killers as there are so many people involved, egging each other on to greater cruelty. Nobody steps in to try to help. They all know it's wrong but the pack aspect seems to wipe that thought away and bond the group instead of any of them experiencing shame.

n5ual9,gx3b59a,/r/TrueCrime/comments/n5ual9/josh_duggar_granted_bail_allowed_to_see_his/gx3b59a/,wishingwellington,"Details of judge's thoughts written by [u/nuggetsofchicken](https://www.reddit.com/user/nuggetsofchicken/) posted at [https://www.reddit.com/r/DuggarsSnark/comments/n5t205/hes\_getting\_released/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DuggarsSnark/comments/n5t205/hes_getting_released/) &#x200B;\-----Judge's thoughts:**Nature of circumstances of charges against Josh:** Presumed innocent. But count 1 carries a mandatory minimum 5 year sentence. Count 2 could carry sentence of 20 years based on the evidence admitted at trial. Court views these charges as very serious. Court is concerned about the evidence describing those charges. It is concerning that that DD file is ""some of the worst sexual abuse child pornography that he has seen in over a thousand cases."" That concerns the courts.The number of images concerns the court. The prepubescent age of the victims concerns the court. The sophistication of the person who downloaded the images concerns the court. It is not the average defendant who can access the Dark Web, who can use partition devices, and who can bypass significant surveillance programs.Children are involuntary victims of pornography and sexual abuse. They're subject often to human trafficking and other circumstances we don't have time to address. The demand and download of child pornography fields the market for the production of this material. The forensic evidence suggests that a significant amount of effort was made to download a significant amount of child sexual material. The weight of the evidence is not insubstantial. That also weighs against Josh.**History and characteristics of Josh:** Josh has a long history in Northwest Arkansas, he's married, has children. He has no drug or alcohol history. It seems that Josh has been involved in various businesses in Arkansas. Josh turned himself in and does not appear to have a history of other crimes. Josh did not seem to obstruct any investigation.The court does not need to treat Josh differently than anyone else similarly situated. However, Josh's family has chosen to make their family life public. Although Josh has never been convicted of any crime, he has admitted to in the past touching children, which concerns the court. That was a public admission, and everyone at this hearing knows it. This concerns the court. What's particularly concerning is the age of Josh's sisters and the age of the children involved with the charges against him.The court is mindful, however, that this conduct happened a long time ago. And it happened when Josh was a child. That fact, and that fact alone, are in Josh's favor. It is concerning to court that Josh has committed that he has an issue with pornography; that is different than child pornography. But what the court has heard is that prior to images being downloaded to Josh's computer, Covenant Eyes was installed which is a program that acts as a deterrent. The court has also heard testimony that Josh's wife may have been his accountability partner on that. The court is not making a determination on that, but it concerns the court.The court is concerned that the ages of the children involved are very similar to the age of Josh's children and the ages of his nieces and his nephews. The court keeps coming back to the age of the children Josh interacts with on a daily basis and is concerned.**Seriousness of the danger Josh poses to the community:** The court does not know. Josh has not been convicted of being a danger to anyone. There is no criminal history that suggests Josh has displayed a pattern of violence to anyone. But Josh's children, his sibling's children, and his minor brothers and sisters are all part of the community that need to be protected from him.This is a very close call. The U.S. Attorney has not met its burden.**Josh Duggar will be released on very strict conditions:**\- Cannot be returned to his guest house or TTH\- Court is not interested in second chances. Don't fuck up with the Reavers. (paragraphsed)\- Tomorrow Josh will be released to the Reavers with close GPS monitoring. Restricted to this residence except for working, education, church, medical services, meeting with lawyers, court ordered obligation, or other activities approved IN ADVANCE by the probation office.\- May not possess or view pornography or erotica of any kind\- Court does not think it has the technology to limit Josh's use. Josh cannot have computers, phones, smart TVs, gaming systems, etc. He may not ask for the passwords from the Reavers or her daughter.\- Josh can get a jitterbug phone to contact counsel as long as it's approved by a probation officer.\- Josh cannot leave the Western District of Arkansas.\- Josh can have unlimited contact with his children as long as their mother is present. Josh cannot have contact with any other minor children including siblings, family members, piano students, etc.\- Not a requirement but a recommendation: Plan activities based on who he might run into. Avoid birthday parties, etc.\- No substances, drugs or alcohol\- Cannot actually or constructively possess a firearm\- Must surrender passport and not obtain a new passport\- May not violate any state or local law\- Must provide a DNA sample\- Must appear in court as requested\- Tomorrow must sign an appearance bond",1428,1620259269.0

Most of the comments left are from their supporters suggesting they pray for Josh and his quick release, and that Anna and the children can move on from this media scandal. I am absolutely astonished, heartbroken and shocked by the lack of responsibility and accountability. **My comment:** All of you are so goddamn delusional, this man is a predator. We can pray for Anna and the children, but Joshua, is a grown man with a history of monstrous behaviour. This man deserves to be legally reprimanded and punished for his actions and the harm he has caused his family, and god forbid the children in his private porn collection. This man deserves what is coming to him. God will judge him accordingly. No Christian in their right mind would or could stand behind someone whose track record of such horror harms the innocent lives of children or young women and boys. For anyone suggesting this man deserves freedom, I highly suggest you collect your thoughts and really focus on where your moral compass points. It is with a full heart, and a background in the legal profession that I strongly advise Anna to take action and separate herself from the man she married – to protect herself and her children.

They go into the strange behavior of the families. To me, the documenary vindicated the parents involvement completely. I also do not agree that they were negligent in any way. What people fail to understand was:1. They left the child in the care of another member of their party who also had kids in the hotel to check on the kids every hour or so. Every 30 minutes or so, another member of the bar would walk to the room and make sure all the kids were okay. Even if the parents *were* negligent, it’s so inhumane to claim that its their fault that Madeleine is missing. Like any of us are perfect or had perfect parents. I can think of a lot of worse parents than them.2. The restaurant and table they were eating at was literally across the street and they could see the window of the room where they kids were. That doesn’t sound that negligent to me. I cannot count the amount of times I’ve read or watched documentaries about innocent people getting convicted of crimes because they “did not look sad enough.” We cannot imagine how grief would affect us. Sometimes we block out the pain completely and act strange. It doesn’t mean we are automatically guilty. The way the media came after the parents here in this disappearance is a demonstration of some of the worst things humans can do to one another. If there was proof, this is a different story entirely but to see so many people continue to blame the parents makes me sick",-15,1620822678.0

Here's a case where a man killed a pregnant woman and two of his young children. It's the most fucked up thing a father, or indeed a human being, can do. But since he's relatively good looking and since Shannan was an assertive woman, out come all of the excuses for him and the judgments for her. If I met Shannan before I would've liked to think we could've been friends. She was outgoing and caring and loving. She tried everything to make her marriage work and would never have suspected her husband to be such a monster. I can't prove this but I have a theory that Chris was sexist himself. If you notice his conversations with women vs. men, there's always this pattern. With the women he doesn't act like himself. He's lying or manipulating the situation to ultimately get what he wants from them. But with the men he talks to them on an equal level.

Missed the word in title.Mikadyn Payne, Trevor Gray, Alexzander Miller, Mark Sekelsky and Kyle Anger  confessed  to having thrown multiple rocks at cars driving south on I-75 from their position on the Dodge Road overpass in Vienna Township. They also confessed to playing a game called ""overpassers"" where hitting a car, which was called a ""dinger,"" earned points. They competed in this for money. The five teenagers had gathered large rocks, one weighing 20 pounds (9.1 kg), from a dead-end street in Vienna Township, loading them into the flatbed of a pickup truck, before driving to the overpass where they were dropped onto cars as they passed below.After hitting the car, the teens fled the scene and ate at a local fast food restaurant. The next day, one of the teens was questioned at school but then released. On Friday, October 20, upon hearing about the victim's death, the 5 teens exchanged text messages, including ones that said ""We could go to prison for life for this, everyone lay low and no one rat us out!"" and ""No one saw us, if everyone shuts up we won't get caught.""The next day, October 21, the police identified the vehicle in which the teens fled. After identifying the owner, the police also sought evidence of who was inside it that night. After reviewing camera footage from the fast food restaurant where the teens ate, the police identified the five teens. The following day, Sunday, October 22, the police contacted the families of the five teens involved, informing them that warrants were out for their arrest. Since they were juveniles, the teens weren't arrested, but were instead told that they would have to surrender to the police by 10PM that day. Kyle Anger (believed to have thrown the rock) reportedly attended church that day and had dinner at a restaurant with his family before surrendering to the police. All of the teens surrendered to the police by 8PM that day.The victim, 32-year-old Kenneth White, was seated in the passenger seat. White, a construction worker, was riding with a co-worker. The rock fractured his skull, chest, and caused other facial injuries. He left behind his fiancée and his four children, the youngest being five years old.[Wikipedia ](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Interstate_75_rock-throwing_deaths&ved=2ahUKEwjxpceTmMb2AhVnSGwGHYh2CCYQFnoECAQQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2q9EfR_wHehQF_r3WdTiCx)[News](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.mlive.com/news/flint/2021/08/3-teens-sentenced-in-clio-rock-throwing-case-that-shattered-victims-family.html%3FoutputType%3Damp&ved=2ahUKEwjxpceTmMb2AhVnSGwGHYh2CCYQFnoECCEQAQ&usg=AOvVaw37vmvxj5D-9jzetv7mzQc2)",1100,1647281112.0

The first one was this one. These kids knew what they were doing. They'd go find very heavy rocks (Wikipedia says one of these rocks were 20 pounds. TWENTY pounds!) and they'd play a game called ""overpass"" where they'd drop these heavy rocks off of the overpass and if they hit a car (which they called a ""dinger"") they got points. They did this often and competed for money.That's atrocious and malicious and way more calculated than just a mistake.  The other one, however, happened in Ohio and killed a man named Marquise Byrd. In this incident it seems like the 4 boys (different boys than the first) were just walking and got a stupid but impulsive idea to throw some rocks and sandbags that were laying on the overpass over the side. They ran away when they heard a car crash but then confessed when they found out it killed someone.This one is more in line to what I'd call a terrible and stupid mistake. From what little research I did, it seems like this was the only time these boys did anything like that and it was an impulse decision.  It's still tragic either way and neither of the victims, Kenneth or Marquise, deserved to be taken from this world too soon. But I think the first set of perpetrators should have had way more punishment than what they did. It's one thing to make a stupid impulse decision that accidentally results in ending a life and quite another thing to play a dangerous gambling game with other people's lives for kicks.",6,1647355141.0

The coward turned on the little boy and lashed out with the blade, scarring him for life.But Nathan helped save Ena, who was knifed eight times but survived. And yesterday, as he jailed Clark for eight and a half years, Lord Brodie described the youngster as ""very courageous indeed"". He said: ""He is a nine-year-old child who tried to protect his mother from a murderous assault by a grownman.""Unusually, the judge allowed Nathan to be named. The youngster is now in line for a police bravery award. Offshore worker Clark, 35, attacked Ena, 33, in revenge after she made an allegation against him which led to him being interviewed by police.He broke into the family's home in Rosyth, Fife, last November and locked the door behind him. Then he appeared in Ena's bedroom doorway with a kitchen knife and told her: ""You tried to ruin my life, now I'm going to ruin yours.""Ena's screams woke Nathan and his sister Shannon, 12. Terrified Shannon locked herself in her room and climbed out of the window into the arms of a neighbour.Nathan battled to protect his mum before he and Ena fled the house in their nightclothes. Ena had five wounds to her chest and three to her face and neck.The attack left the whole family traumatised. The court heard that the children were ""deeply affected"" by what they saw.Hours before Clark stabbed Ena, he encountered her husband, a former friend, in a local pub and challenged him to fight.As the thug was thrown out, he said: ""I'm going to murder your wife and I'll get you later.""The husband never heard the threat and felt guilty afterwards because he had not protected his wife. Clark, of Rosyth, admitted attempting to murder Ena and leaving Nathan disfigured.He said he had only meant to frighten Ena and had drunk so much that he could not remember the attack. He added that he deeply regretted stabbing Nathan.Clark's guilty plea saved him from a 12-year sentence.After the case at the High Court in Glasgow, Nathan's proud parents described him as a very special boy. Ena said: ""He is our priority at the moment."" “[source](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/nine-year-old-hero-hailed-for-saving-mum-971314.amp)",347,1611656466.0

It’s given us a bit of time, as well ascontinuing to disrupt his life, so we’re all for it.“As far as I understand the conditions, the nearest he could live to us isGlenrothes, which is 21 miles away.“He’s violent and a serious menace, mainly to women, so wherever he settlespeople should watch out.”Nathan Thompson1Nathan was scarred for life after being stabbed by Clark with a 10in knife.Only the bridge of his nose stopped the blade going into his brain. Theattack came after Ena told cops she’d been sexually assaulted by Clark.She said yesterday: “He took a knife from our kitchen, came up to my room,told me I’d ruined HIS life and tried to kill me in front of mykids.“Anyone who can do what he did to a woman and child will always bedangerous.”Ena had been stabbed eight times by Clark when Nathan jumped on his back —allowing her to flee.The lad received a string of awards for his heroism during their 2007 ordeal.Ena — who spent three days on life support in hospital before pulling through— added: “It’s the bravest thing I’ve ever seen, a wee boy tackling a grownman with a knife to protect his mum.”Clark — who was jailed in March 2008 — is also banned from enteringInverkeithing under his bail conditions.",7,1611668662.0

The blow knocked her into unconsciousness, which could have led someone to believe she was dead.”He continued: “The strangulation came 45 minutes to two hours after the head strike, based on the swelling on the brain. While the head wound would have eventually killed her, the strangulation actually did kill her. The rest of the scene we believe was staged, including the vaginal trauma, to make it look like a kidnapping/assault gone bad.”Other suspicious evidence included:\- The police later determined the ransom note was written on paper from a notebook in the Ramsey house. A practice note had already been written and after the final note was finished, the notepad was returned to the place they had been found.When the handwriting was analyzed by experts to determine if either parent had written the ransom note, Patsy wrote “$118,000” out fully in words as if purposefully trying to be different from the note. Beckner commented: “The handwriting experts noted several strange observations.”\- The only people known to be in the house the night of JonBenet’s death were JonBenét, Burke, Patsy, and John Ramsey. When the police conducted a cursory search of the house – just 3 minutes after the initial emergency call talk place – they did not find any sign of a break-in or forced entry.\- Nylon cord and the broken handle of a paintbrush had been tied around JonBenet’s neck apparently to strangle her. Part of the bristle end of the paintbrush was found in Patsy Ramsey’s art supplies.\- Due to their highly regarded status in the Boulder community, police were told not to interrogate the Ramseys. Beckner recalls, “After that initial day, we felt pressure from the DA’s office not to push too hard on the Ramseys. This was a constant source of frustration and much could be written about this and the reasons for it.”&#x200B;Source: [https://crimeviral.com/2020/12/death-of-jonbenet-ramsey-the-brother-did-it-theory-explained/](https://crimeviral.com/2020/12/death-of-jonbenet-ramsey-the-brother-did-it-theory-explained/)",801,1628241608.0

I think far too often we jump on the bandwagon and go with a theory that has nothing to back it up, especially when it involves family of a victim because it would be the simpler answer. We have to remember that not all crime scene information has not been released to the general public. The so called trauma to her genitals (listed as an abrasion on the autopsy report) has also been called irritation that could have come from a urinary tract infection that she was recently treated for, (as I child I had frequent urinary tract infections and they would sometimes cause itchiness which can lead to scratching) not saying that happened here, only mentioning my experience. There is also foreign DNA that hasn't matched anyone and while that could be a red-herring, I tend to not believe that. We shouldn't be out here calling someone who has never been convicted of or even charged with a crime, a murderer because some TV show special told us that he killed his sister. I also know that handwriting analysis is largely thought to be pseudo science these days and has been proven to not always be accurate.

The kids being abused might also explain Burke’s odd behavior and being so detached: in a matter of a couple of weeks since his sister passed, a child psychologist asks him to draw his family and he drew his mom and dad, when asked if someone is missing he says oh yeah, me. Never thought to add his little sister. So I might sound like a looney, but I am also intrigued and repulsed at the Epstein case, and also by the MK ultra and Monarch projects conducted by the CIA. I am pretty sure I will get downvoted for this, but to me it makes a bit of sense, and these (rich) people have the means to cover up anything. I will also add that the recent DNA evidence from a blood stain on her panties point to at least 2 male DNAs. Also, the DA pushing for the family to not be pressed is odd, even though they were wealthy as well, I don’t think they were that wealthy to bribe the DA.Edit: I am bringing a really far fetched theory to the table.",4,1628256518.0

Why would the parents use their own note pad, and pen and then put it back? Like I get being forgetful but that’s just stupid. And both of them were apparently pretty intelligent. Plus why would they fake a kidnapping in a ransom note, instead of saying they murdered her instead in the ransom note? It just logically makes no sense if they wanted to make themselves look innocent they made themselves look more guilty than not doing anything at all. I’ve personally always thought it was someone who wanted to frame the dad. Using the notepad and pen from the house, and putting it back makes them look super guilty. It’s actually kind of brilliant if you think of someone wanting to frame someone. Making mistakes like that on purpose. It explains the ransom note too, all to make them look guilty. I will also never buy the brother doing it. A 9 year old isn’t going to be charged with murder. So why would they further abuse her body just to make it seem like he didn’t do anything? They could of said it was an accident and rushed her to the hospital. Just doesn’t make sense why they would sexually abuse their dead child, strangle her dead body, and write a huge ransom note that made no sense when they could of just said it was an accident and nothing would of happened.

When he was found and taken to the hospital he had significant internal bleeding and was ""hours away from passing."" The person who kidnapped him and murdered another kid a year prior is currently in prison for a 100 year sentence. He stated that he did not remember committing his crimes. When the police examined his journal, they found a to-do list full of people's names that included the categories ""Can Wait,"" ""Get To Now,"" and ""The Leg Thing."" The argument that it wasn't pre-meditated obviously did not fly. 14 yo Chris Steiner was his previous victim from the year prior, but sadly he died from his bone injuries. It is fortunate, however, that Thad bravely escaped, otherwise many other children could have been killed. I found this case interesting because I had never heard of it before despite how gruesome it was.

The boy who shot him looked up to Joe Clark.2. Clark masturbated during the torture. There was definitely a sexual element for him.3. Clark saw himself as a vigilante. He had a “kill list” (mostly popular kids and bullies) and a “protect list” (my cousin was on this list, which is the only reason I know it existed). I was far enough off his radar not to make either list.4. No, there was nothing giving him away. He looked, dressed, and even walked just like any other semi-popular boy in the area.5.

He also re-twisted his ankles, kicked him in his already broken knee, but jumped on the kid while he was in the bed.The kid mentioned that he had to drag himself head first down the stairs, and the pain of the stairs on his legs were so intense, he blacked out half way down the stairs.

All those ableist slurs and the audacity to believe she was diagnosed with BPD really shows your lack of empathy (who's the monster now?).I was diagnosed with BPD, and guess what? It took TWO fucking years. Not only that, but FOUR different doctors had given me the diagnosis after I was hospitalized following a severe mental breakdown that caused me to become massively suicidal, all thanks to my abusive and narcissistic ex.I ended up meeting 8 out of the 9 diagnostic criteria for BPD (guess I must be a crazy psycho bunny boiler bitch, amirite?), and guess what? If you used your brain or have any critical thinking skills in your hippocampus, BPD DOES NOT present itself the same in everyone. Why? Because in order to be officially diagnosed, one must meet at least 5 of the 9 criteria, therefore there are 256 combinations of BPD. And guess what? We're not fucking murders. I guess by your neurotypical logic, Pete Davidson, Marilyn Monroe, Amy Winehouse, and Princess Diana are/were ""murderous, bunny boiling, psychos"", cuz they all have/had fucking BPD. If ya'll wanna stop being ignorant sociopaths with zero empathy and critical thinking skills, then I invite you to go to the r/BPD subreddit.

This is the type of ableist and stigmatizing fuckery that makes me feel so unwelcome in the true crime community. No compassion whatsoever for an already stigmatized group of people who are more likely to die by suicide cuz society hates us so much.P.S. Jodi is a full-blown narcissist.
